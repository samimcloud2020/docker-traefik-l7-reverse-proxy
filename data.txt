we’re defining two services: traefik and whoami. 
The traefik service is the Traefik reverse proxy itself, 
and the whoami service is a simple HTTP server that will be routed by Traefik.

For the whoami service,
we’ve added some Traefik-specific labels that instruct Traefik to 
route traffic to the whoami service using the hostname whoami.local.

With this configuration, if you run docker-compose up, you should be able to access the whoami service by navigating 
to http://whoami.local in your web browser. Traefik will automatically route the traffic to the whoami container.
You can also access the Traefik dashboard at http://localhost:8080/dashboard/.
